### Hi there 👋

I'm currently the Engineering Director and Co-founder at Altitude Games Pte. Ltd. Everything tech related is under my department. I manage and mentor a team of talented engineers who specialize in making games using Unity.

I'm currently learning and exploring WebGL game engines and blockchain game development.
